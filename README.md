# CosmologyProject
Repository for code used in solving the Friedmann equation numerically using MATLAB.

Programs are ready to run. When running FriedmannCOS.m or FriedmannLOOKBACK.m make sure you have Ringermacher.txt.

FriedmannCOS.m solves the Friedmann equation using cosmological time.
FriedmannLOOKBACK.m solves the Friedmann equation using lookback time.

FriedmannGeometries.m uses a different method of solving the Friedmann equation than FriedmannCOS.m and FriedmannLOOKBACK.m due to the nature MATLAB ODE solvers work.
